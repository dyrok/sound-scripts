# Sound Scripts üëÇ
The Sound Script is a simple Python script for playing audio files on Windows. The script uses the winsound module to play WAV or MIDI files in a loop. The number of times the sound is played can be specified by the user.

okay so this script i wrote at 2am because my mom was reading hanuman chalisa 7 times and i had an idea what if i had a program which i could use to play it for her 7 times... so i realised i can do it using python so i created this... Literally out of no where i woke up. turned on my pc and started typing. this program will play a sound n number of times (n is specified by the User) and shutdown the pc, i had a partial knowledge of using os module and winsound in python so i used them after that i added the Error Elimination using try and except. an great example how python would be helpfulin dad to day life
